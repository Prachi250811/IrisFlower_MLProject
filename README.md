# Iris Flower Classification
# Problem Statement
The iris flower (Iris) is classified into three primary species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. These species exhibit distinct differences in sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, making them suitable for classification using machine learning techniques.

# Objective

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify iris flowers into their respective species based on their physical measurements. This classification will aid in automating plant identification processes with applications in botany and horticulture.

# Project Details

Dataset: The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, each with four features—sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Models Used: Various machine learning models were explored, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree Classifier.

Feature Importance: Feature analysis showed that petal length and petal width are the most significant in classification.

Significance: Automating the classification of iris species can assist botanists, researchers, and horticulturists in species identification and analysis.

# Results

The best-performing models based on accuracy scores:

# Model                    Accuracy Test (%)              

 Logistic Regression       95.55                       

 K-Nearest Neighbors       97.77                      

 Decision Tree (tuned)     97.77         

# Conclusion

After testing various models, the tuned Decision Tree model was selected as the final classifier due to its high accuracy and balanced performance. Key takeaways include:

- Iris-Setosa is distinctly different from the other species, making it easier to classify.

- Versicolor and Virginica overlap slightly in some measurements, requiring robust models for accurate classification.

- The model demonstrated high accuracy, making it suitable for real-world applications.
